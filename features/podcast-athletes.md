1. Overview

The purpose of this feature is to enhance user engagement and differentiate our app by linking athlete mentions in podcast episodes to their dedicated athlete pages. This feature will use natural language processing (NLP) to identify athlete names from episode titles and descriptions pulled via RSS feeds and create direct links to their respective athlete pages within the app.

2. Objectives

Increase user engagement by providing contextual athlete information directly from podcast episodes.

Strengthen the app’s position as the go-to platform for running enthusiasts by seamlessly connecting podcasts with athlete profiles.

Enable users to discover new athletes and follow their updates more efficiently.

3. Key Features

Athlete Name Parsing:

Use NLP to extract potential athlete names from podcast titles and descriptions.

Cross-reference identified names with the existing athlete database.

Linking Mechanism:

Automatically generate clickable links for parsed athlete names that direct to their athlete pages.

Handle multiple athletes mentioned in a single title/description.

Error Handling:

Provide a fallback mechanism (e.g., flag for review) when ambiguous names or multiple matches are found.

Allow manual curation for edge cases.

User Experience:

Highlight linked athlete names within podcast episode details.

Provide visual cues for clickable links (e.g., underline, color change).

4. User Stories

As a user, I want to click on an athlete’s name mentioned in a podcast episode description to view their athlete profile.

As an admin, I want to review flagged ambiguous names to ensure accurate linking.

As a user, I want to discover new athletes I hear about in podcasts without leaving the app.

5. Technical Specifications

5.1 Data Sources

RSS Feeds: Existing feed for podcast episodes.

Athlete Database: Centralized database containing athlete profiles with unique identifiers, aliases, and metadata (e.g., full name, nicknames).

5.2 Parsing Process

Tokenization and Named Entity Recognition (NER):

Use pre-trained NLP models (e.g., spaCy, Hugging Face) to identify proper nouns likely to be athlete names.

Train custom models if pre-trained models lack accuracy for running-specific content.

Database Matching:

Match parsed names against the athlete database using fuzzy matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance).

Account for variations like nicknames, hyphenated names, or initials.

Ambiguity Resolution:

Implement a scoring system for matches based on context (e.g., frequency of name mention, surrounding keywords like "marathon," "Olympics").

Flag uncertain matches for manual review.

5.3 Efficiency Measures

Cache frequent queries to reduce database lookup times.

Use batching for processing multiple episodes in parallel.

Employ serverless architecture for scaling during peak usage.

5.4 Edge Cases

Common Names: Disambiguate athletes with common names by using additional context (e.g., "Boston Marathon winner").

Name Variations: Ensure recognition of variations (e.g., "Eliud Kipchoge" vs. "Kipchoge").

False Positives: Avoid linking non-athlete names that resemble athlete names (e.g., "John Runner" is a podcaster, not an athlete).

Multiple Matches: Allow users to select from a list when multiple athletes match a name.

6. Metrics for Success

Engagement Rate: Percentage of users interacting with athlete links.

Click-through Rate (CTR): Frequency of clicks on athlete links.

Accuracy: Percentage of correctly linked athlete names.

Resolution Time: Average time to resolve flagged names.
