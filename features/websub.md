Please enter planner mode, and think thru ways to improve this process. For our websub subscriptions, I'm looking to make a few adjustments and have a few questions:. 
1. We are currently updating the websub subscriptions as part of the podcast update process (/content api route). But that is only part of the update process. Is there a way to configure the api route so that we can specifically target podcasts that have a websub subscription that gets updated every 24 hours so that the lease doesn't expire.
2. While we are successfully updating the subscriptions, I'm not seeing any POST requests to the api/websub/callback route when new content is added

Review the existing code and the pubsubhub for ways to ensure we're receiving the updates via POST requests: @https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com 

Here are some responses to common questions:
1. How frequently are you currently seeing subscriptions expire? Are you seeing any errors in logs related to subscription verification?
- I haven't really been seeing them expire, but because of the way we do the updates randomly, they could be expiring. I haven't seen any logs.
2. Have you verified that your callback URL is publicly accessible from the internet? The hub needs to be able to reach your callback endpoint.
- I believe the hub is able to reach the callback endpoing, what parameters do I need to pass in order to test it?
3. Are you using any kind of signature verification with your WebSub subscriptions? I see the code supports it, but want to confirm it's properly configured.
- I believe so, but no sure
4. Have you tried using the PubSubHubbub debug tools at https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/ to test your subscriptions manually?
- I have and it works as expected
5. Are there any network restrictions (firewalls, etc.) that might be blocking incoming POST requests to your callback URL?
- No
6.Have you checked if the podcast feeds you're subscribing to are actually being updated with new content? According to the research, the hub only sends notifications when it detects changes in the feed.
- Yes, this is what made me look into this issue. I saw a podcast be updated, but didn't see it update or any POST request to the websub api route
